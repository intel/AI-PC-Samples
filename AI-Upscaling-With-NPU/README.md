## Purpose

This sample notebook shows how to leverage Intel® AI Boost Neural Processing Unit (NPU) to boost the performance of AI upscaling. We will use `OpenVINO` to upscale images and video using the `BSRGAN` model.

The sample starts by loading in the `BSRGAN` model and then converts and compiles the model for the NPU using `OpenVINO`. After loading the model, the sample applies the model to a sample image and video to demonstrate the upscaling capabilities of the model as well as the performance benefits of using the NPU.

## Run the `AI Upscaling with Intel® AI Boost NPU` Sample

### Using `uv`

The sample uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for environment management. Steps to install `uv` can be found [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/). 

1. Setup the environment

    ```bash
    # ffmpeg OS binary
    conda install ffmpeg

    # python dependencies
    uv sync
    ```


5. Execute the Jupyter Notebook via command line

    ```bash
    uv run jupyter nbconvert --execute --to notebook --inplace --debug AI_Upscaling_With_NPU.ipynb
    ```

## Opening Jupyter Notebook

If you choose to run the Jupyter Notebook directly, you can open the Jupyter Notebook by running the following command:

### Using `uv`

```bash
uv run jupyter notebook AI_Upscaling_With_NPU.ipynb
```

### Using VScode

Open the notebook and select the appropriate Python interpreter:

- For Windows: Open the notebook and select `.venv\Scripts\python.exe` as the Python interpreter.
- For Linux: Open the notebook and select `.venv/bin/python` as the Python interpreter.

## Example Output

Users should be able to see a side-by-side comparison of the original and upscaled images and videos as well as the performance comparison between running the model on the CPU and NPU.
