## Requirements
To set up your AIPC for running with Intel iGPUs, follow these essential steps:
1. Update Intel GPU Drivers: Ensure your system has the latest Intel GPU drivers
2. Install Visual Studio 2022 Community edition with C++: Visual Studio 2022, along with the “Desktop Development with C++” workload, is required.
3. Install conda-forge: conda-forge will manage your Python environments and dependencies efficiently, providing a clean, minimal base for your Python setup
4. Install CMake
