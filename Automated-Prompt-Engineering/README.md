## Purpose

We use DSPy, an automatic prompt engineering framework to create a pipeline for answering riddles and optimize the prompts for that task to improve few-shot performance using Llama.cpp and Intel GPUs (Intel Arc™ Graphics, Intel® Core™ Ultra, or any compatible Intel Graphics).

## Run the `Automated Prompt Engineering` Sample

The command for both Windows and Linux will install the necessary dependencies and run the sample. The sample uses [`pixi`](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi/) for environment and task management.

### Windows

1. Download [MS Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?q=build+tools#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022)
2. Download the [oneAPI Base Toolkit](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/base-toolkit-download.html). **Make sure to keep the installation directory as `C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI`**.

To run the sample, run the following command inside "Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022"

```cmd
.\tools\run_pixi.cmd run execute
```

### Linux

1. Download the [oneAPI Base Toolkit](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/base-toolkit-download.html). **Make sure to keep the installation directory as `/opt/intel/oneapi`**.

To run the sample, run the following command:

```bash
./tools/run_pixi.sh run execute
```

## Key Implementation Details

This sample tutorial contains one Jupyter Notebook.

### Exporting Dependencies to Conda Environment

**Exporting dependencies to a `conda` environment not necessary for running the sample.**

[`pixi`](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi/) relies on the [`conda-forge`](https://conda-forge.org/) project and [`PyPi`](https://pypi.org/) for package retrieval. This means that you can use `pixi` to export dependencies to a `conda` environment and use this exact environment in other projects.

#### Windows

To export the dependencies to a `conda` environment, run the following command:

```
.\tools\run_pixi.ps1 project export conda-environment --platform linux-64 environment.yml
```

This will create a `conda` environment file named `environment.yml`.

#### Linux

To export the dependencies to a `conda` environment, run the following command:

```
./tools/run_pixi.sh project export conda-environment --platform linux-64 environment.yml
```

### Cleaning Up

To clean up the created environment, delete the `.pixi` directory located in the root of the sample.

## Example Output

Users should be able to see an accuracy increase in answering riddles using DSPy for automated prompt engineering. The user will also see GPU utilization as the LLM runs on the GPU.
