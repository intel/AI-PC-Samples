# Genre-Driven Storytelling from Images using PyTorch XPU backend
## Overview
This sample explores the generation of creative, genre-specific stories from images, specifically optimized for Intel hardware using the PyTorch XPU backend. 
The core of the sample lies in its ability to understand visual content through the VLM and then weave a story that adheres to the conventions and style of the selected genre. By utilizing the PyTorch XPU backend, this sample aims for efficient computation and accelerated story generation on Intel Arc GPUs and other compatible hardware.

## Sample Workflow
It takes an image and a user-defined genre (e.g., fantasy, horror, romance, sci-fi) as input and leverages a Vision Language Model (VLM) to craft engaging narratives that are visually inspired and thematically aligned with the chosen genre.

## Run the `Genre-driven Storytelling` Sample:

1. Navigate to the sample directory:
   ```bash
   cd <path/to/Genre-driven-storytelling/folder>
   ```
   
2. Log in to Hugging Face, generate a token, and download the required model:\
   `huggingface-cli` lets you interact directly with the Hugging Face Hub from a terminal. Log in to [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/) with your credentials. You need a [User Access Token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens) from your [Settings page](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens). The User Access Token is used to authenticate your identity to the Hub.\
   Once you have your token, run the following command in your terminal.
   ```
   uv run huggingface-cli login
   ```
   This command will prompt you for a token. Copy-paste yours and press Enter.
   ```
   uv run huggingface-cli download Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct
   ```
   
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook
   ```bash
   uv run jupyter lab
   ```
   > If you face any dependencies issues, please clean your uv environment and try again
   > ```bash
   > uv clean
   > ```

### AI PC from Intel
<div class="alert alert-block alert-info"> <b>NOTE:</b> You can run the step on both, <b>Windows and Ubuntu</b>. </div>

1. Open the [Genre driven storytelling](./Genre-driven-storytelling.ipynb) notebook file in the jupyter notebook, select the default kernel i.e. `Python(ipykernel)` and run the code cells one by one in the notebook.

### Intel Tiber AI Cloud
1. Follow these steps in a new terminal session. Create and select the `uv_env` Jupyter kernel to get access to required python packages in the notebook.
   ```
   uv sync
   uv run python -m ipykernel install --user --name=uv_env --display-name="uv_env"
   ```

2. Open the [Automated Logo Generation](./Automated_Logo_Generation.ipynb) notebook file in the jupyter notebook, select the `uv_env` environment.

## Sample Execution
GPU utilization would be observed as this sample is optimized to run on Intel XPUs.
