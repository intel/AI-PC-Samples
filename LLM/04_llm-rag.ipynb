    "# Create a RAG system on AIPC using Ollama\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction  \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to run LLM inference for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application using Ollama locally on an AI PC. It is optimized for Intel® Core™ Ultra processors, utilizing the combined capabilities of the CPU, GPU, and NPU for efficient AI workloads. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an AI PC?  \n",
    "\n",
    "An AI PC is a next-generation computing platform equipped with a CPU, GPU, and NPU, each designed with specific AI acceleration capabilities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fast Response (CPU)**  \n",
    "  The central processing unit (CPU) is optimized for smaller, low-latency workloads, making it ideal for quick responses and general-purpose tasks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **High Throughput (GPU)**  \n",
    "  The graphics processing unit (GPU) excels at handling large-scale workloads that require high parallelism and throughput, making it suitable for tasks like deep learning and data processing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Power Efficiency (NPU)**  \n",
    "  The neural processing unit (NPU) is designed for sustained, heavily-used AI workloads, delivering high efficiency and low power consumption for tasks like inference and machine learning.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The AI PC represents a transformative shift in computing, enabling advanced AI applications like LLM-based RAG workflows to run seamlessly on local hardware. This innovation enhances everyday PC usage by delivering faster, more efficient AI experiences without relying on cloud resources.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we’ll explore how to use the AI PC’s capabilities to perform LLM inference and integrate it into a RAG pipeline, showcasing the power of local AI acceleration for modern applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** is a technique for augmenting LLM knowledge with additional, often private or real-time, data. LLMs can reason about wide-ranging topics, but their knowledge is limited to the public data up to a specific point in time that they were trained on. If you want to build AI applications that can reason about private data or data introduced after a model’s cutoff date, you need to augment the knowledge of the model with the specific information it needs. The process of bringing the appropriate information and inserting it into the model prompt is known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)."
