    "”An AI PC has a CPU, a GPU and an NPU, each with specific AI acceleration capabilities. An NPU, or neural processing unit, is a specialized accelerator that handles artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) tasks right on your PC instead of sending data to be processed in the cloud. The GPU and CPU can also process these workloads, but the NPU is especially good at low-power AI calculations. The AI PC represents a fundamental shift in how our computers operate. It is not a solution for a problem that didn’t exist before. Instead, it promises to be a huge improvement for everyday PC usages.”"

    "\n",
    "1. Update Intel GPU Drivers: Ensure your system has the latest Intel GPU drivers, which are crucial for optimal performance and compatibility. You can download these directly from Intel's [official website](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/785597/intel-arc-iris-xe-graphics-windows.html) . Once you have installed the official drivers, you could also install Intel ARC Control to monitor the gpu:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Install Visual Studio 2022 Community edition with C++: Visual Studio 2022, along with the “Desktop Development with C++” workload, is required. This prepares your environment for C++ based extensions used by the intel SYCL backend that powers accelerated Ollama. You can download VS 2022 Community edition from the official site, [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).\n",
